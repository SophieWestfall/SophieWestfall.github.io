      <p> It was a little after four o'clock on an Indian Summer afternoon. Some fifteen or twenty times since noon, Sandra, the maid, had come away from the lake-front window in the kitchen with her mouth set tight. This time as she came away, she absently untied and re-tied her apron strings, taking up what little slack her enormous waistline allowed. Then she went back to the enamel table and lowered her freshly uniformed body into the seat opposite Mrs. Snell. Mrs. Snell having finished the cleaning and ironing was having her customary cup of tea before walking down the road to the bus stop. Mrs. Snell had her hat on. It was the same interesting, black felt headpiece she had worn, not just all summer, but for the past three summers- through record heat waves, through change of life, over scores of ironing boards, over the helms of dozens of vacuum cleaners. The Hattie Carnegie label was still inside it, faded but (it might be said) unbowed. </p>

  <p> "I'm not gonna worry about it," Sandra announced, for the fifth or sixth time, addressing herself as much as Mrs. Snell. "I made up my mind I'm not gonna worry about it. What for?" </p>

  <p> "That's right," said Mrs. Snell. "I wouldn't. I really wouldn't. Reach me my bag, dear."
  A leather handbag, extremely worn, but with a label inside it as impressive as the one
  inside Mrs. Snell's hat, lay on the pantry. Sandra was able to reach it without standing
  up. She handed it across the table to Mrs. Snell, who opened it and took out a pack of
  mentholated cigarettes and a folder of Stork Club matches.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Snell lit a cigarette, then brought her teacup to her lips, but immediately set it
  down in its saucer. "If this don't hurry up and cool off, I'm gonna miss my bus." She
  looked over at Sandra, who was staring, oppressedly, in the general direction of the
  copper sauce-pans lined against the wall. "Stop worryin' about it," Mrs. Snell ordered.</p>

      <p>"What good's it gonna do to worry about it? Either he tells her or he don't. That's all.
      What good's worryin' gonna do?"</p>
      <p>"I'm not worryin' about it," Sandra responded. "The last thing I'm gonna do is worry
  about it. Only, it drives ya loony, the way that kid goes pussyfootin' all around the
  house. Ya can't hear him, ya know. I mean nobody can hear him, ya know. Just the
  other day I was shellin' beans- right at this here table- and I almost stepped on his
  hand. He was sittin' right under the table."</p>

  <p>"Well. I wouldn't worry about it."</p>

  <p>"I mean ya gotta weigh every word ya say around him," Sandra said. "It drives ya
  Loony."</p>

  <p>"I still can't drink this," Mrs. Snell said. ". . . That's terrible. When ya gotta weigh
  every word ya say and all."</p>

  <p>"It drives ya loony! I mean it. Half the time I'm half loony." Sandra brushed some
  imaginary crumbs off her lap, and snorted. "A four-year-old kid!"</p>

  <p>"He's kind of a good-lookin' kid," said Mrs. Snell. "Them big brown eyes and all."
  Sandra snorted again. "He's gonna have a nose just like the father." She raised her
  cup and drank from it without any difficulty. "I don't know what they wanna stay up
  here all October for," she said malcontentedly, lowering her cup. "I mean none of 'em
  even go anywheres near the water now. She don't go in, he don't go in, the kid don't go
  in. Nobody goes in now. They don't even take that crazy boat out no more. I don't know
  what they threw good money away on it for."</p>
