    <h2> My Love, My Heart, My Soulmate, </h2>
    <p> Today is Day 7!!! Only two more to go!! I see little
      pieces of you baby everywhere I go. I want you to know how much I love
      you and how much I appreciate you. I will never stop seeing life the way
      I do having you in my life, I see little things and I get so excited to
      show you or tell you about it :) That is why I always get you small
       little things baby because they remind me of you and that is why I love
        making you so many art things because you may think it is for me and im
        just showing you but I always do things that make me think of you and
        smile :) I am madly and deeply in love with you and I will always make
         art for you and you will always be my muse. I love you and I feel honored
         to be able to say you are mine and I am yours. I belong to you baby, I
          mean it. Only you, from now until forever. I love you always baby and
          I shall see you soon. I cant wait to hold you in my arms baby, I miss
           you so much. I love you i love you i love you. I am going to keep
         my tears in because I need to see to code but god baby i love you so much.
