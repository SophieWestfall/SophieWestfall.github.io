      <p>Hi baby today is Day 5
Instead of linking to another site I thought since today is Day 5,
 you are going to need some extra loving maybe so I am going to write you.
 I know this is a desktop so I hope this isn’t too much to read. I love you
 baby and I miss you so much. As I am writing this, you are in Mississippi and
 you are sleeping on the couch with Lori and Cassidy. Well cassidy is on the floor
  because she is scared since you guys saw a black cat lol I love you baby and you
   dont know how badly I wish I could be there with you to experience it all with you.
   I asked my mom again about the wifi on the ship and she said no too expensive again
   :/ I just even if its for one night probably like Day 5 or Day 6 just because thats
    a long time and i really am having baby withdrawals. I hope you haven’t forgotten
     about me baby and that you are alllll mine. I know you are. Just have to say it.
  I love you baby, I hope you are eating well and that your headaches are doing okay.
   I also hope that your back is ok and the ringing in your ear. I cant wait to be hold
    to massage and take care of all your aches and pains in your little body baby. I want
    to make you the happiest girl in the world. Would you let me marry you baby so i can
    make sure every day i do atleast one thing to make you smile. I hope these websites
    really do make you feel special baby. I have been doing them at night so i can really
    focus on them and thats why i have been going to bed so late just because i didnt want
     you to know what the surprise was. I love you so much and i cant wait to come home
     and we can go on our date to the drive in and we can kiss and we can hold hands and eat
     junk foods and just be in love. I love you baby :) and I know this is long but I
      just want to make sure you feel all the love. I am forever married to
     you baby and you have my heart. I’ll be home soon to you baby, i love you. oh boy
     getting emotional now. ANYWAY!!! we dont cry here :) i really miss you baby, you
     are my home. my happy. my love. I just love you so much :) See you soon angel</p>
