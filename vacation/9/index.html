<h2>Last Day Baby!! </h2>
<p>Baby, today is the last day!!! We will
   finally be in the same state again :)
   I cant wait to come home to you and see you
   again and kiss you. I miss you so badly baby. My body and mind
   genuinely can not be apart from you like this. I am so happy you
   are on your family vacation right now (as im writing this)
   and I just want to be with you and experience all of
   the world with you. I love you so much and i cant wait to
   come home to you. I dont even care if all we do is sit in your
    dads shop baby, I just want to be with you and in your presence.
    Baby to be with you is the best gift I have ever been gifted. I will
    never take you for granted ever again baby. I cant. be. without. you.
     I love you so much and you make me the happiest
   girl in the whole universe. Being your girlfriend baby makes me feel
   like I can do anything the world throws at me. I love you. You are my
   happiness and I cant wait to be home with you angel. I am going to
   kiss those lips soon and hold your soft skin once again.
   xoxo I love you my sugar cookie
