    <h2> My Love, </h2>
    <p> Hi Baby! Today is Day 4. I miss you so much and I cant
      believe how much my body even misses you like to imagine
      myself laying next to you in bed and feeling your skin against
      mine, like even your legs graze mine, I can die happily. I love
       you. Baby lay with me for the rest of our life. I love you and
       I can stay in bed just at peace with you forever baby. I love
        you and I cant wait to see you. I love you I love you I know i
         said it a billion times but oh my goodness do I mean it more
         than anything. Well I know today is only day 4 baby but I know
         you may be a little bored so I researched some game sites baby
          just to keep you busy. I doubt they will be that good but I dont
           know, I thought maybe a little something. I love you baby and
           enjoy these games. I cant wait to come home and to play games
            with you, and to beg you to play Rules of Survival with me
            :) xoxo I love you sunshine, See you soon </p>
