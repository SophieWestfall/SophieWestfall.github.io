             <p style="padding: 10%;"> "It is perfectly acceptable
to not be okay every day. Putting yourself
first is not the end of the world. It is okay to make
other people feel like they are on top of the world
as long as you don’t forget about yourself and your own health along the way.
<span>Make art everyday.</span> Be proud of your paintings
and designs. Learn from mistakes and make sure
to share your work and not keep it to yourself. It
is an honor to be considered an artist, therefore,
never loose your passion. Appreciate the art around
you and use it to grow. Work towards your future
every day. Notice your own accomplishments and
changes as much as you notice others people’s.
Never take your talent for granted. Limit the use of
negative words in your vocabulary and gain more positive outlook on life. Don’t invalidate anyone’s
feelings or ideas. Think and observe before making
an assumption. Don’t take the people around you for
granted and appreciate everyone you have in your life. Be happy. Be considerate.
Be nice.""</p>
