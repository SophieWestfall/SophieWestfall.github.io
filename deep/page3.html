    <p>"No," she said, and pushed back some hair behind her
ear. She added, purely informatively: "He's been hitting the road regularly since he was
two. But never very hard. I think the farthest he ever got- in the city, at least- was to
the Mall in Central Park. Just a couple of blocks from home. The least far- or nearest--
he ever got was to the front door of our building. He stuck around to say goodbye to his
father."</p>

<p>Both women at the table laughed.</p>

<p>"The Mall's where they all go skatin' in New York," Sandra said very sociably to Mrs.
Snell. "The kids and all."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Snell.</p>

<p>"He was only three. It was just last year," Boo Boo said, taking out a pack of cigarettes
and a folder of matches from a side pocket in her jeans. She lit a cigarette, while the two
women spiritedly watched her. "Big excitement. We had the whole police force out
looking for him."</p>

<p>"They find him?" said Mrs. Snell.</p>

<p>"Sure they found him!" said Sandra with contempt. "Wuddaya think?"</p>

<p>"They found him at a quarter past eleven of night, in the middle of- my God,
February, I think. Not a child in the park. Just muggers, I guess, and an assortment of
roaming degenerates. He was sitting on the floor of the bandstand, rolling a marble
back and forth along a crack. Half-frozen to death and looking- "</p>

<p>"Holy Mackerel!" said Mrs. Snell. "How come he did it? I mean what was he runnin'
away about?"</p>

<p>Boo Boo blew a single, faulty smoke-ring at a pane of glass. "Some child in the park
that afternoon had come up to him with the dreamy misinformation, `You stink, kid.' At
least, that's why we think he did it. I don't know, Mrs. Snell. It's all slightly over my
head."</p>

<p>"How long's he been doin' it?" asked Mrs. Snell. "I mean how long's he been doin' it?"</p>

<p>"Well, at the age of two-and-a-half," Boo Boo said biographically, "he sought refuge
under a sink in the basement of our apartment house. Down in the laundry. Naomi
somebody- a close friend of his- told him she had a worm in her thermos bottle. At
least, that's all we could get out of him." Boo Boo sighed, and came away from the
window with a long ash on her cigarette. She started for the screen door. "I'll have
another go at it," she said, by way of goodby to both women.</p>

<p>They laughed.</p>

<p>"Mildred," Sandra, still laughing, addressed Mrs. Snell, "you're gonna miss your bus if
ya don't get a move on."</p>

<p>Boo Boo closed the screen door behind her.</p>

<p>She stood on the slight downgrade of her front lawn, with the low, glaring, late
afternoon sun at her back. About two hundred yards ahead of her, her son Lionel was
sitting in the stem seat of his father's dinghy. Tied, and stripped of its main and jib
sails, the dinghy floated at a perfect right angle away from the far end of the pier. Fifty
feet or so beyond it, a lost or abandoned water ski floated bottom up, but there were no
pleasure boats to be seen on the lake; just a stern-end view of the county launch on its
way over to Leech's Landing.</p>
