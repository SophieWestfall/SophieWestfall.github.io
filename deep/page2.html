<p>"I don't know how you can drink yours. I can't even drink mine."</p>

<p>Sandra stared rancorously at the opposite wall. "I'll be so gladda get backa the city.
I'm not foolin'. I hate this crazy place." She gave Mrs. Snell a hostile glance. "It's all right
for you, you live here all year round. You got your social life here and all. You don't
Care."</p>

<p>"I'm gonna drink this if it kills me," Mrs. Snell said, looking at the clock over the
electric stove.</p>

<p>"What would you do if you were in my shoes?" Sandra asked abruptly. "I mean what
would you do? Tella truth."</p>

<p>This was the sort of question Mrs. Snell slipped into as if it were an ermine coat. She
at once let go her teacup. "Well, in the first place," she said, "I wouldn't worry about it.
What I'd do, I'd look around for another--"</p>

<p>"I'm not worried about it," Sandra interrupted.</p>

<p>"I know that, but what I'd do, I'd just get me- "</p>

<p>The swinging door opened from the dining room and Boo Boo Tannenbaum, the lady
of the house, came into the kitchen. She was a small, almost hipless girl of twenty-five,
with styleless, colorless, brittle hair pushed back behind her ears, which were very
large. She was dressed in knee-length jeans, a black turtleneck pullover, and socks and
loafers. Her joke of a name aside, her general unprettiness aside, she was-in terms of
permanently memorable, immoderately perceptive, small-area faces-a stunning and
final girl. </p>

<p> She went directly to the refrigerator and opened it. As she peered inside, with
her legs apart and her hands on her knees, she whistled, unmelodically, through her
teeth, keeping time with a little uninhibited, pendulum action of her rear end. Sandra
and Mrs. Snell were silent. Mrs. Snell put out her cigarette, unhurriedly.</p>

<p>"Sandra . . ."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am?" Sandra looked alertly past Mrs. Snell's hat.</p>

<p>"Aren't there any more pickles? I want to bring him a pickle."</p>

<p>"He et 'em," Sandra reported intelligently. "He et 'em before he went to bed last night.
There was only two left."</p>

<p>"Oh. Well, I'll get some when I go to the station. I thought maybe I could lure him out
of that boat." Boo Boo shut the refrigerator door and walked over to look out of the lakefront
window. "Do we need anything else?" she asked, from the window.</p>

<p>"Just bread."</p>

<p>"I left your check on the hall table, Mrs. Snell. Thank you."</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Mrs. Snell. "I hear Lionel's supposeta be runnin' away." She gave a short
laugh.</p>

<p>"Certainly looks that way," Boo Boo said, and slid her hands into her hip pockets.</p>

<p>"At least he don't run very far away," Mrs. Snell said, giving another short laugh.
At the window, Boo Boo changed her position slightly, so that her back wasn't directly
to the two women at the table.</p>
