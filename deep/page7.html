  <p>"Sandra- told Mrs. Smell--that Daddy's a big--sloppy- kike."</p>

<p>Just perceptibly, Boo Boo flinched, but she lifted the boy off her lap and stood him in
front of her and pushed back his hair from his forehead. "She did, huh?" she said.</p>
<p>Lionel worked his head up and down, emphatically. He came in closer, still crying, to
stand between his mother's legs.</p>

<p>"Well, that isn't too terrible," Boo Boo said, holding him between the two vises of her
arms and legs. "That isn't the worst that could happen." She gently bit the rim of the
boy's ear. "Do you know what a kike is, baby?"</p>

<p>Lionel was either unwilling or unable to speak up at once. At any rate, he waited till
the hiccupping aftermath of his tears had subsided a little. Then his answer was
delivered, muffled but intelligible, into the warmth of Boo Boo's neck. "It's one of those
things that go up in the air," he said. "With string you hold."</p>

<p>The better to look at him, Boo Boo pushed her son slightly away from her. Then she
put a wild hand inside the seat of his trousers, startling the boy considerably, but
almost immediately withdrew it and decorously tucked in his shirt for him. "Tell you
what we'll do," she said. "We'll drive to town and get some pickles, and some bread, and
we'll eat the pickles in the car, and then we'll go to the station and get Daddy, and then
we'll bring Daddy home and make him take us for a ride in the boat. You'll have to help
him carry the sails down. O.K.?"</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Lionel.</p>

<p>They didn't walk back to the house; they raced. Lionel won.</p>
